This is a list of all existing and some planned documentation files, along
with their rough quality level:

[     ] - file not yet written, or empty stub
[*    ] - file has some random WIP information, but lacks proper structure
          and may start off in the middle of things
[**   ] - file has at least the main structure and a reasonable amount of
          useful information
[***  ] - file has been written, but there is a relatively large  number of
          unknown things about the area it covers, or some sections of the
	  file are still missing
[**** ] - file has been written and is mostly complete, but there are still
          some small unknowns or information pending verification
[*****] - file is complete and fully verified
