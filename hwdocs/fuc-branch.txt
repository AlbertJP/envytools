= Introduction =

The flow control instructions on fuc include conditional relative branches,
unconditional absolute branches, absolute calls, and returns. Calls use the
stack in data segment for storage fo return addresses [see fuc-data.txt].
The conditions available for branching are based on the low 12 bits of $flags
register:

 - bits 0-7: $p0-$p7, general-purpose predicates
 - bit 8: c, carry flag
 - bit 9: o, signed overflow flag
 - bit a: s, sign flag
 - bit b: z, zero flag

c, o, s, z flags are automatically set by many ALU instructions, $p0-$p7 have
to be explicitely manipulated. See fuc-arith.txt for more details.

Address of the current instruction is always available through the read-only
$pc special register.


= Pseudocode conventions =

$pc is usually automatically incremented by opcode length after each
instruction - documentation for other kinds of instructions doesn't mention
it explicitely for each insn. However, due to the nature of this category
of instructions, all effects on $pc are mentioned explicitely in this file.

oplen is the length of the currently executed instruction in bytes.

See also conventions from fuc-arith.txt and fuc-data.txt.


= Conditional branch: bra =

Branches to a given location if the condition evaluates to true. Target is
$pc-relative.

Instructions:
	bra $pX - if predicate true		subopcode = 00+X
	bra c - if carry			subopcode = 08
	bra o - if overflow			subopcode = 09
	bra s - if signed			subopcode = 0a
	bra z / bra e - if zero / equal		subopcode = 0b
	bra a - if above			subopcode = 0c
	bra na - if not above			subopcode = 0d
	bra - always				subopcode = 0e
	bra not $pX - if predicate false	subopcode = 10+X
	bra nc - if not carry			subopcode = 18
	bra no - if not overflow		subopcode = 19
	bra ns - if not signed			subopcode = 1a
	bra nz / bra ne - if not zero / equal	subopcode = 1b
	bra g - if greater			subopcode = 1c [v3+ only]
	bra le - if less or equal		subopcode = 1d [v3+ only]
	bra l - if less				subopcode = 1e [v3+ only]
	bra ge - if greater or equal		subopcode = 1f [v3+ only]

= Unconditional branch: bra =

Branches to the target. Target is specified as absolute address. Yes, the
immediate forms are pretty much redundant with the relative branch form.

Instructions:
	bra - branch
Instruction class: unsized
Operands: TRG
Forms:
	I8				opcode = f4, subopcode = 20
	I16				opcode = f5, subopcode = 20
	R2				opcode = f9, subopcode = 4
Immediates: zero-extended
Operation:
	$pc = TRG;


= Subroutine call: call =

Pushes return address onto stack and branches to the target. Target is
specified as absolute address.

Instructions:
	call - Call a subroutine
Instruction class: unsized
Operands: TRG
Forms:
	I8				opcode = f4, subopcode = 21
	I16				opcode = f5, subopcode = 21
	R2				opcode = f9, subopcode = 5
Immediates: zero-extended
Operation:
	$sp -= 4;
	ST(32, $sp, $pc + oplen);
	$pc = TRG;


= Subroutine return: ret =

Returns from a previous call.

Instructions:
	ret - Return from a subroutine
Instruction class: unsized
Operands: -
Forms:
	[no operands]			opcode = f8, subopcode = 0
Operation:
	$pc = LD(32, $sp);
	$sp += 4;
