C

component: one of the values associated with samples in a surface, or a single
element of a vector. For color values, the components are commonly called R,
G, B, A. For zeta surfaces, the components are Z [depth], S [stencil], and C
[coverage].


E

element: a basic unit of a surface for memory layout purposes. Can be 1, 2,
4, 8, or 16 bytes long. Depending on surface type, can represent a single
sample, or a block of samples.


I

IGP: integrated graphics processor, a GPU integrated into the northbridge,
lacking dedicated VRAM.


R

render target - a surface bound to the 2d or 3d engine as the destination. The
2d engine has a single color render target. The 3d engine can have, depending
on card, up to 8 color render targets and 1 zeta render target.


S

sample: a basic conceptual unit of a surface, a sample corresponds to a single
set of component values.

storage type:  [XXX]

surface: a 2d or 3d array of samples, elements, or bytes, depending on the
viewpoint - depending on how it's used, it can be a render target, a texture,
a framebuffer, etc. [nv50-surface.txt]

surface element: see element

surface format: information including the element size of a surface, layout
of the element, interpretation of element data, and components available
in a surface

surface type: the main classification of surfaces. A surface can be a color
surface, or a zeta surface. A color surface can be a simple color surface,
YUV surface, compressed texture surface, or a bitmap surface


T

texture: a surface bound to the texturing units for sampling. This includes
the 2d source surface on nv50+ cards.


V

VRAM: video RAM, the main working area of the card, a big area of RAM located
on the card connected directly to the GPU. The IGPs don't have real VRAM, and
instead use a special area of system RAM as fake VRAM.


Z

zeta surface: a surface containing the depth buffer, optionally the stencil
buffer, and the special coverage component if coverage sampling is in use
[see nv50-surface.txt]
