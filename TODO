Queue for immediate execution:

 - check allowed s[] kinds for all insns.
 - const spaces: how many bits do addresses have?
 - cvt with rounding modes. also, what does it do?

Branching
 - branching/joining?
 - why are there two types of call?
 - what does quadon do?
Predicates
 - what if you try to predicate joins/exits?
 - which instructions ignore predicates?
Counting stuff
 - $a5-$a7?
 - how to set up all the memory spaces and how big are they?
Misc
 - orthogofuckingnalise cvt. MORE.
 - try to make sense and orthogonalise atomic stuff and load/stores.
 - figure out paired movs.
 - libGL blob uses weird 0x00010000 flag on cvt's with rounding. wtf?
 - what the fuck is up with a different shared memory load insn on >=sm_11?
 - how to do bar sync, and how does it work?

Cleanup for after everything is said and done:
 - edge cases everywhere, write descriptions.
 - look for XXXes.
 - make sure all cvt's work as expected

Disassembler stuff
 - cleanup cvt mess.
 - make $a0 show as 0?

Shader-related:
 - How big are v[] and a[]?
 - GP emit instruction: supports combo with restart?
 - life after discard
   - kills a shader instantly, or just sets a flag?

Needs to be checked experimentaly by running code:
 - what exactly happens when DST is unallocated?
 - check all addressing bit combinations with long, short, immediate insns.
   try to involve instructions with all possible argcnts.
 - verify multi-$a addressing...
 - check how and where p[] works
 - check lfm1 and lfm2 on all float operations.
 - what happens for unaligned long instructions?
On non-CP:
 - check exact encoding for a[] and v[], figure out size and what's in there.
Needs sm_12 or sm_13:
 - cvt weirdness: cvt.rpi.f64 on 1.25, cvt.rmi.f64 on -1.25
 - how does shared atomic work with locking/unlocking exactly?
