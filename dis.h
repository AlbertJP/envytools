/*
 * Table format
 *
 * Decoding various fields is done by multi-level tables of decode operations.
 * Fields of a single table entry:
 *  - bitmask of program types for which this entry applies
 *  - value that needs to match
 *  - mask of bits in opcode that need to match the val
 *  - a sequence of 0 to 8 operations to perform if this entry is matched.
 *
 * Each table is scanned linearly until a matching entry is found, then all
 * ops in this entry are executed. Length of a table is not checked, so they
 * need either a terminator showing '???' for unknown stuff, or match all
 * possible values.
 *
 * A single op is supposed to decode some field of the instruction and print
 * it. In the table, an op is just a function pointer plus a void* that gets
 * passed to it as an argument. atomtab is an op that descends recursively
 * into another table to decude a subfield. T(too) is an op shorthand for use
 * in tables.
 *
 * Each op takes five arguments: output file to print to, pointer to the
 * opcode being decoded, pointer to a mask value of already-used fields,
 * a free-form void * specified in table entry that called this op, and
 * allowed program type bitmask.
 *
 * The mask argument is supposed to detect unknown fields in opcodes: if some
 * bit in decoded opcode is set, but no op executed along the way claims to
 * use it, it's probably some unknown field that could totally change the
 * meaning of instruction and will be printed in bold fucking red to alert
 * the user. Each op ors in the bitmask that it uses, and after all ops are
 * executed, main code prints unclaimed bits. This works for fields that can
 * be used multiple times, like the COND field: it'll be read fine by all ops
 * that happen to use it, but will be marked red if no op used it, like
 * an unconditional non-addc non-mov-from-$c insn.
 *
 * This doesn't work for $a, as there is a special case here: only the first
 * field using it actually gets its value, next ones just use 0. This is
 * hacked around by zeroing out the field directly in passed opcode parameter
 * in the op reading it. This gives proper behavior on stuff like add b32 $r0,
 * s[$a1+0x4], c0[0x10].
 *
 * Macros provided for quickly getting the bitfields: BF(...) gets value of
 * given bitfield and marks it as used in the mask, RCL(...) wipes it
 * from the opcode field directly, allowing for the $a special case. Args are
 * given as start bit, size in bits.
 *
 * Also, three simple ops are provided: N("string") prints a literal to output
 * and is supposed to be used for instruction names and various modifiers.
 * OOPS is for unknown encodings, NL is for separating instructions in case
 * a single opcode represents two [only possible with join and exit].
