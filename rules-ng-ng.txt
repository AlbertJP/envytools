1. Introduction

rules-ng is a package consisting of a database of nvidia GPU registers in XML
format, and tools made to parse this database and do useful work with it. It
is in mostly usable state, but there are some annoyances that prevent its
adoption as the home of all nouveau documentation.

Note that this document and rules-ng understands "register" quite liberally as
"anything that has an address and can have a value in it, written to it, or
read to it". This includes conventional MMIO registers, as well as fields of
memory structures and grobj methods.

Its parsable XML format is supposed to solve three problems:

 - serve as actual documentation for the known registers: supports attaching
   arbitrary text in <doc> tags and generating HTML for easy reading.
 - name -> hex translation: supports generating C headers that #define all
   known registers, bitfields and enum values as C constants.
 - hex -> name translation: you tell it the address or address+value of a
   register, and it decodes the address to its symbolic name, and the value to
   its constituting bitfields, if any. Useful for decoding mmio-traces /
   renouveau dumps, as well as standalone use.

What's non-trivial about all this [ie. why rules-ng is not a long series of
plain address - name - documentation tuples]:

 - The registers may be split into bitfields, each with a different purpose
   and name [and separate documentation].
 - The registers/bitfields may accept values from a predefined set [enum],
   each with a different meaning. Each value also has a name and
   documentation.
 - The registers may come in multiple copies, forming arrays. They can also
   form logical groups. And these groups can also come in multiple copies,
   forming larger arrays... and you get a hierarchical structure.
 - There are multiple different GPU chipsets. The available register set
   changed between these chipsets - sometimes only a few registers, sometimes
   half the card was remade from scratch. More annoyingly, sometimes some
   registers move from one place to another, but are otherwise unchanged.
   Also [nvidia-specific], new grobj classes are sometimes really just new
   revisions of a base class with a few methods changed. In both of these
   cases, we want to avoid duplication as much as possible.

2. Proposed new XML format

2.1. General tags

Root tag is <database>. There is one per the whole file and it should contain
everything else.

<brief> and <doc> are tags that can appear inside any other tag, and document
whatever it defines. <brief> is supposed to be a short one-line description
giving a rough idea what a given item is for if no sufficiently descriptive
name was used. <doc> can be of any length, can contain some html and html-like
tags, and is supposed to describe a given item in as much detail as needed.
There should be at most one <doc> and at most one <brief> tag for any parent.

Tags that define top-level entities include:

 <variant-set>: Declares a set of slightly different, but similar variants of
                something
 <domain>: Declares an addressing space containing registers
 <group>: Declares a block of registers, expected to be included by one or
          more <domain>s
 <bitset>: Declares a list of applicable bitfields for some register
 <enum>: Declares a list of applicable values for some field, like C enum

Each of these has an associated global name used to refer to them from other
parts of database. As a convenience, and to allow related stuff to be kept
together, the top-level entities are allowed to occur pretty much anywhere
inside the XML file except inside <doc> tags. This implies no scoping,
however: the effect is the same as putting the entity right below <database>.

Another top-level tag that can be used anywhere is the <import> tag. It's used
like <import file="foo.xml"/> and makes all of foo.xml's definitions available
to the containing file. If a single file is <import>ed more than one time, all
<import>s other than the first are ignored.

2.2. Variants

Variants are slightly different versions of something. The variant space is
"multidimensional" - so you can have a variant "dimension" representing what
GPU chipset you're using at the moment, and another dimension representing
what grobj class you're dealing with [taken from another set of variants].
Both of these can be independent. We call such dimensions as <variant-set>s.
A <variant-set> defintion looks like that:

<variant-set name="chipset">
	<brief>The chipset of the card</brief>
	<variant name="NV04">
		<brief>RIVA TNT</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant name="NV05">
		<brief>RIVA TNT2</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant name="NV10">
		<brief>GeForce 256</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant name="NV50">
		<brief>G80: GeForce 8800 GTX, Tesla *870, ...</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant name="NV84">
		<brief>G84: GeForce 8600 GT, ...</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant name="NVA0">
		<brief>G200: GeForce 260 GTX, Tesla C1060, ...</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant name="NVA5">
		<brief>GT216: GeForce GT 220</brief>
	</variant>
	<variant-group name="NV0x" variants="NV04 NV05">
		<brief>NV04 generation cards</brief>
	</variant-group>
	<variant-group name="pre50" variants="NV0x NV10" />
	<variant-group name="NV5x" variants="NV50 NV84 NVA0 NVA5" />
	<variant-group name="old5x" variants="NV50 NV84" />
	<variant-group name="NV10+" variants="NV10 NV5x" />
</variant-set>

If enabled for a given domain, the name of the earliest variant to support
a given register / bitfield / value / whatever will be automatically prepended
to its name. For this purpose, "earliest" is defined as "comes first in the
XML file". For this reason, <variant> names are expected to be uppercase-only.

The <variant-group>s are merely a shorthand to type less, they'll get expanded
on sight. So their names will never make it to the header file, and can be of
any case.

Also, <variant>s may have a hex id associated with them -- useful if they
represent something that is selectable by poking that value into some other
register, like the grobj classes. In this case, the variant-set containing
them can be referenced by <use-enum> tag. Example:

<variant-set name="grobj-class">
	<variant name="NV04_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT" id="0x0039" />
	<variant name="NV50_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT" id="0x5039" />
	<variant name="NV50_2D" id="0x502d" />
	<variant name="NV50TCL" id="0x5097" />
	<variant name="NV84TCL" id="0x8297" />
	<variant-group name="m2mf" variants="NV04_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT NV50_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT" />
</variant-set>

In generated .h file, this will result in:

#define NV04_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT	0x0039
#define NV50_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT	0x5039
#define NV50_2D				0x502d
#define NV50TCL				0x5097
#define NV84TCL				0x8297

2.3. Domains

All register definitions ultimately belong to a <domain>. <domain> is
basically just a single address space. So we'll have a domain for the MMIO
BAR, one for each type of memory structure we need to describe, a domain for
the grobj/FIFO methods, and a domain for each indirect index-data pair used to
access something useful.

A "width" of a domain refers to the size, in bits, of a single addressable
unit. This is 8 by default for usual byte-addressable memory, but 32 can be
useful occasionally for indexed spaces of 32-bit cells. Values sane enough to
support for now include 8, 16, 32, 64.

A "size" of a domain is total number of addressable units it spans. Can be
undefined if you don't know it or it doesn't make sense.

The "prefix" of a domain selects the string that should be prepended to name
of every child item. The special value "none" means no prefix. The special
value "name" means prefixing with the domain name, and is the default. All
other values are looked up as <variant-set> names and, for each child item,
its name is prefixed with name of the earliest variant in the given set that
supports given item. Also, multiple prefixes can be appended by separating the
values with spaces: prefix="chipset name" will get you names like
NV04_NV_MMIO_PMC_BOOT_0.

<domain name="NV_MMIO" size="0x1000000" prefix="chipset">
	<reg32 offset="0" name="PMC_BOOT_0" />
	<reg32 offset="4" name="PMC_BOOT_1" varset="chipset" variants="NV10+" />
	<reg32 offset="0x100" name="PMC_INTR" />
</domain>

Describes a space with 0x1000000 of 8-bit addressable cells. Cells 0-3 belong
to NV04_PMC_BOOT_0 register, 4-7 belong to NV10_PMC_BOOT_1 register,
0x100-0x103 belong to NV04_PMC_INTR register, and remaining cells are either
unused or unknown. The generated .h definitions are:

#define NV_MMIO__SIZE		0x10000000
#define NV04_PMC_BOOT_0		0
#define NV10_PMC_BOOT_1		4
#define NV04_PMC_INTR		0x100

<domain name="NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP" width="32" size="6">
	<reg32 offset="0" name="STATUS" />
	<reg32 offset="1" name="CHANNEL" />
	<reg32 offset="2" name="UNK2" />
	<reg32 offset="3" name="ADDRLOW" />
	<reg32 offset="4" name="ADDRMID" />
	<reg32 offset="5" name="ADDRHIGH" />
</domain>

Defines a 6-cell address space with each cell 32 bits in size and
corresponding to a single register. Definitions are:

#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP__SIZE		6
#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP_STATUS		0
#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP_CHANNEL	1
#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP_UNK2		2
#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP_ADDRLOW	3
#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP_ADDRMID	4
#define NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP_ADDRHIGH	5

2.4. Additional prefixing

Sometimes a single prefix= attribute per domain is not enough, and you want
some part prefixed with one style of prefixes, and another part not prefixed
at all, or prefixed with something else. This is what <prefix> is for:

<domain name="OBJECT">
	<prefix prefix="chipset name">
		<reg32 offset="0" name="NAME" />
		<reg32 offset="0x10" name="FENCE_ADDRESS_HIGH" varset="chipset" variants="NV5x" />
		<!-- more FENCE stuff -->
		<reg32 offset="0x60" name="DMA_SEMAPHORE" varset="chipset" variants="NV10+" />
		<!-- more SEMAPHORE stuff -->
	</prefix>
	<prefix prefix="grobj-class">
		<reg32 offset="0x328" name="BUFFER_NOTIFY" varset="grobj-class" variants="m2mf" />
		<!-- more m2mf methods -->
		<reg32 offset="0x368" name="LAUNCH" varset="grobj-class" variants="NV50_COMPUTE" />
		<!-- more NV50_COMPUTE methods -->
	</prefix>
</domain>

Results in:

#define NV04_OBJECT_NAME				0
#define NV50_OBJECT_FENCE_ADDRESS_HIGH			0x10
#define NV10_OBJECT_DMA_SEMAPHORE			0x60
#define NV04_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT_BUFFER_NOTIFY	0x328
#define NV50_COMPUTE_LAUNCH				0x368

2.5. Registers

What we really want all the time is defining registers. This is done with
<reg8>, <reg16>, <reg32> or <reg64> tags. The register of course takes
reg_width / domain_width cells in the domain. It's an error to define a
register with smaller width than the domain it's in. The <reg*> attributes
are:

 - name [required]: the name of the register
 - offset [required]: the offset of the register
 - access [optional]: "rw" [default], "r", or "w" to mark the register as
   read-write, read-only, or write-only. Only makes sense for real MMIO
   domains.
 - varset [optional]: the <variant-set> to choose from by the variant
   attribute. defaults to first variant-set used in currently active prefix.
 - variants [optional]: space-separated list of <variant>s and
   <variant-group>s that support this register
 - type [optional]: How to interpret the contents of this register, if it has
   no bitfields or enum values. Space-separated list of types in decreasing
   order of preference. Generally useful values include: "uint" being unsigned
   decimal integer of appropriate size, "int" being signed decimal integer,
   "hex" being unsigned hexadecimal integer, "float" being IEEE 32-bit
   floating point format. Unrecognised type is not an error, and parsing
   application should just fall back to the first type it knows. Failing that,
   it should fall back to "hex". "hex" is also the default value if this field
   is not specified.
 - shr [optional]: the value in this register is the real value shifted right
   by this many bits. Ie. for register with shr="12", register value 0x1234
   should be interpreted as 0x1234000. May sound too specific, but happens
   quite often in nvidia hardware.
 - length [optional]: if specified to be other than 1, the register is treated
   as if it was enclosed in an anonymous <stripe> with corresponding length
   and stride attributes, except the __ESIZE and __LEN stripe defines are
   emitted with the register's name. If not specified, defaults to 1.
 - stride [optional]: the stride value to use if length is non-1. Defaults to
   the register's size in cells.

The definitions emitted for a non-stripe register include only its offset and
shr value. Other informations are generally expected to be a part of code
logic anyway:

<reg32 offset="0x400784" name="PGRAPH_CTXCTL_SWAP" shr="12" />

results in

#define PGRAPH_CTXCTL_SWAP	0x400784
#define PGRAPH_CTXCTL_SWAP__SHR	12

For striped registers, __LEN and __ESIZE definitions like <stripe> are emitted
too:

<!-- in a 8-bit domain -->
<reg32 offset="0x0600" name="NV50_COMPUTE_USER_PARAM" length="64" />

results in

#define NV50_COMPUTE_USER_PARAM(i)	(0x600 + (i)*4)
#define NV50_COMPUTE_USER_PARAM__LEN	64
#define NV50_COMPUTE_USER_PARAM__ESIZE	4

The <reg*> tags can also contain either bitfield definitions, or enum value
definitions.

2.6. Enums

Enum is, basically, a set of values. They're defined by <enum> tag with the
following attributes:

 - name [required]: an identifying name.
 - inline [optional]: "yes" or "no", with "no" being the default. Selects if
   this enum should emit its own definitions in .h file, or be inlined into
   any <reg*> / <bitfield> definitions that reference it, as if <use-enum>
   tag was replaced by its contents.
 - prefix [optional]: only for no-inline enums, behaves like prefix attribute
   to <domain>.

The <enum> tag contains <value> tags with the following attributes:

 - name [required]: the name of the value
 - value [required]: the value
 - varset [optional]: like in <reg*>
 - variants [optional]: like in <reg*>

The <enum>s are referenced from inside <reg*> and <bitfield> tags by <use-enum
name="..." /> tag. For single-use enums, the <value> tags can also be written
directly inside <reg*> tag. Also, a <variant-set> name can be used instead of
<enum> name in <use-enum> name, if the <variant-set> includes <variant>s with
numerical ids. The variant name-id pairs will be used as <value>s in this
case.

<enum name="SURFACE_FORMAT" prefix="chipset">
	<value value="6" name="A8R8G8B8" />
	<value value="0x12" name="A8R8G8B8_RECT" variants="NV10+" />
</enum>

<enum name="gl_shade_model" inline="yes">
	<value value="0x1d00" name="FLAT" />
	<value value="0x1d01" name="SMOOTH" />
</enum>

<reg32 offset="0x1234" name="TEXTURE_FORMAT">
	<use-enum name="SURFACE_FORMAT" />
</reg32>
<reg32 offset="0x1238" name="SHADE_MODEL">
	<use-enum name="gl_shade_model" />
</reg32>
<reg32 offset="0x123c" name="PATTERN_SELECT">
	<value value="1" name="MONO" />
	<value value="2" name="COLOR" />
</reg32>

Result:

#define NV04_SURFACE_FORMAT_A8R8G8B8		6
#define NV04_SURFACE_FORMAT_A8R8G8B8_RECT	0x12
#define TEXTURE_FORMAT				0x1234
#define SHADE_MODEL				0x1238
#define     SHADE_MODEL_FLAT			0x1d00
#define     SHADE_MODEL_SMOOTH			0x1d01
#define PATTERN_SELECT				0x123c
#define     PATTERN_SELECT_MONO			1
#define     PATTERN_SELECT_COLOR		2

2.7. Bitfields

Often, registers store not a single full-width value, but are split into
bitfields. Like values can be grouped in enums, bitfields can be called in
bitsets. The <bitset> tag has the same set of attributes as <enum> tag, and
contains <bitfield> tags with the following attributes:

 - name [required]: name of the bitfield
 - low [required]: index of the lowest bit belonging to this bitfield. bits
   are counted from 0, LSB-first.
 - high [required]: index of the highest bit belonging to this bitfield.
 - varset [optional]: like in <reg*>
 - variants [optional]: like in <reg*>
 - type [optional]: like in <reg*>
 - shr [optional]: like in <reg*>

Like <value>s, <bitfield>s are also allowed to be written directly inside
<reg*> tags. You cannot use both <bitfield>s and <value>s for a single <reg*>.

<bitfield>s themselves can contain <value>s or <use-enum>s. The defines
generated for <bitfield>s include "name" equal to the bitmask corresponding to
given bitfield, "name__SHIFT" equal to the low attribute, "name__SHR" equal to
the shr attribute [if defined]. If the bitfield contains any <value>s or
references an inlined enum, defines for its values are also generated,
pre-shifted to the correct position. Example:

<enum name="nv03_operation" inline="yes">
	<value value="0" name="SRCCOPY_AND" />	
	<value value="1" name="ROP_AND" />	
	<value value="2" name="BLEND_AND" />	
	<value value="3" name="SRCCOPY" />	
	<value value="4" name="SRCCOPY_PRE" />
	<value value="5" name="BLEND_PRE" />
</enum>

<bitset name="NV04_GROBJ_1">
	<bitfield high="7" low="0" name="GRCLASS" />
	<bitfield high="12" low="12" name="CHROMA_KEY" />
	<bitfield high="13" low="13" name="USER_CLIP" />
	<bitfield high="14" low="14" name="SWIZZLE" />
	<bitfield high="17" low="15" name="PATCH_CONFIG">
		<use-enum name="nv03_operation" />
	</bitfield>
	<!-- ... -->
</bitset>

<bitset name="xy16" inline="yes">
	<bitfield high="15" low="0" name="X" />
	<bitfield high="31" low="16" name="Y" />
</bitset>

<reg32 offset="0x40014c" name="PGRAPH_CTX_SWITCH_1">
	<use-bitset name="NV04_GROBJ_1" />
</reg32>

<reg32 offset="0x0404" name="FORMAT">
	<bitfield high="15" low="0" name="PITCH" />
	<bitfield high="23" low="16" name="ORIGIN" />
	<bitfield high="31" low="24" name="FILTER" />
</reg32>

<reg32 offset="0x040c" name="POINT">
	<use-bitset name="xy16" />
</reg32>

Result:

#define NV04_GROBJ_1_GRCLASS			0x000000ff
#define NV04_GROBJ_1_GRCLASS__SHIFT		0
#define NV04_GROBJ_1_CHROMA_KEY			0x00001000

2.8. Arrays and stripes.

Sometimes you have multiple copies of a register. Sometimes you actually have
multiple copies of a whole set of registers. And sometimes this set itself
contains multiple copies of something. This is what <array>s are for. The
<array> represents "length" units, each of size "stride" packed next to each
other starting at "offset". Offsets of everything inside the array are
relative to start of an element of the array. The <array> attributes include:

 - name [required]: name of the array, also used as prefix for all items
   inside it
 - offset [required]: starting offset of the array.
 - stride [required]: size of a single element of the array, as well as the
   difference between offsets of two neighboring elements
 - length [required]: Number of elements in the array
 - varset [optional]: As in <reg*>
 - variants [optional]: As in <reg*>

The definitions emitted for an array include:
 - name(i) defined to be the starting offset of element i
 - name__LEN defined to be the length of array
 - name__ESIZE defined to be the stride of array

Also, definitions for all items inside the array that involve offsets become
parameter-taking C macros that calculate the offset based on array index. For
nested arrays, this macro takes as many arguments as there are indices
involved.

It's an error if an item inside an array doesn't fit inside the array element.

<array offset="0x408000" name="PGRAPH_TP" stride="0x1000" length="8">
	<array offset="0x200" name="MP" stride="0x80" length="2">
		<!-- ... -->
		<reg64 offset="0x70" name="TRAPPED_OPCODE" />
		<!-- ... -->
	</array>
	<reg32 offset="0x314" name="MP_TRAP />
	<!-- ... -->
</array>

#define PGRAPH_TP(i)				(0x408000+(i)*0x1000)
#define PGRAPH_TP__LEN				8
#define PGRAPH_TP__ESIZE			0x1000
#define PGRAPH_TP_MP(i,j)			(0x408200+(i)*0x1000+(j)*0x80)
#define PGRAPH_TP__LEN				2
#define PGRAPH_TP__ESIZE			0x80
#define PGRAPH_TP_MP_TRAPPED_OPCODE(i,j)	(0x408270+(i)*0x1000+(j)*0x80)

<stripe>s are somewhat similar to arrays, but don't reserve space, merely say
that all items inside come in "length" copies "stride" cells apart. As opposed
to <array>s, items can have offsets larger than stride, and offsets aren't
automatically assumed to be a part of <stripe> unless a <reg*> explicitely
hits that particular offset for some index. Also, <stripe>s of length 1 and
stride 0 can be used as generic container, for example to apply a variant set
or a prefix to a bigger set of elements. Attributes:

 - name [optional]: like in <array>. If not given, no prefixing happens, and
   the defines for <stripe> itself aren't emitted.
 - offset [optional]: like <array>. Defaults to 0 if unspecified.
 - stride [optional]: the difference between offsets of items with indices i
   and i+1. Or size of the <stripe> if it makes sense in that particular
   context. Defaults to 0.
 - length [optional]: like in array. Defaults to 1.
 - varset [optional]: as in <reg*>
 - variants [optional]: as in <reg*>

Definitions are emitted like for arrays, but:
 - if no name is given, the definitions for stripe itself won't be emitted
 - if length is 1, the defines for the <stripe> and its children don't include
   the index parameter and __LEN is not emitted
 - if length is 0, the length is assumed to be unknown or undefined. No __LEN
   is emitted in this case.
 - if stride is 0, __ESIZE is not emitted
 - it's an error to have stride 0 with length different than 1


Examples:

<stripe name="PGRAPH" offset="0x400000" variants="NV0x">
	<reg32 offset="0x100" name="INTR" />
	<reg32 offset="0x140" name="INTR_EN" />
</stripe>

<stripe name="PGRAPH" offset="0x400000" variants="NV5x">
	<reg32 offset="0x100" name="INTR" />
	<reg32 offset="0x108" name="TRAP" />
	<reg32 offset="0x138" name="TRAP_EN" />
	<reg32 offset="0x13c" name="INTR_EN" />
</stripe>

Results in:

#define NV04_PGRAPH		0x400000
#define NV04_PGRAPH_INTR	0x400100
#define NV04_PGRAPH_INTR_EN	0x400140
#define NV50_PGRAPH		0x400000

#define NV50_PGRAPH_TRAP_EN	0x400138
#define NV50_PGRAPH_INTR_EN	0x40013c

2.9. Groups

Groups are just sets of registers and/or arrays that can be copied-and-pasted
together, when they're duplicated in several places in the same <domain>,
two different <domain>s, or have different offsets for different variants.
<group> and <use-group> only have the name attribute. <use-group> can appear
wherever <reg*> can, including inside a <group>.

<group name="nv50_mp">
	<!-- ... -->
	<reg64 offset="0x70" name="TRAPPED_OPCODE" />
	<!-- ... -->
</group>

<array offset="0x408000" name="PGRAPH_TP" stride="0x1000" length="8" variants="pre50">
	<array offset="0x200" name="MP" stride="0x80" length="2">
		<use-group name="nv50_mp" />
	</array>
	<!-- ... -->
</array>
<array offset="0x408000" name="PGRAPH_TP" stride="0x800" length="10" variants="NVAx">
	<array offset="0x100" name="MP" stride="0x80" length="4">
		<use-group name="nv50_mp" />
	</array>
	<!-- ... -->
</array>

Will get you:

#define NV50_PGRAPH_TP_MP_TRAPPED_OPCODE(i, j) 	(0x408270 + (i)*0x1000 + (j)*0x80)
#define NVA0_PGRAPH_TP_MP_TRAPPED_OPCODE(i, j) 	(0x408170 + (i)*0x800 + (j)*0x80)

3. The utilities.

The header generation utility will take a set of XML files and generate .h
file with all of their definitions, as defined above.

The HTML generation utilty will take an XML file and generate HTML
documentation out of it. The documentation will include the <brief> and <doc>
tags in some way, as well as information from all the attributes, in some easy
to read format. Some naming scheme for the HTML files should be decided, so
that cross-refs to HTML documentation generated for <import>ed files will work
correctly if the generator is run in both.

The lookup utility will perform database lookups of the following types:

 - domain name, offset, access type, variant type[s] -> register name + array
   indices if applicable
 - the above + register value -> same as above + decoded value. For registers
   with bitfields, print all bitfields, and indicate if any bits not covered
   by the bitfields are set to 1. For registers/bitfields with enum values,
   print the matching one if any. For remaining registers/bitfields, print
   according to type attribute.
 - bitset name + value -> decoded value, as above
 - enum name + value -> decoded value, as above

The mmio-parse utility will parse a mmio-trace file and apply the second kind
of database lookups to all memory accesses matching a given range. Some
nv-specific hacks will be in order to automate the parsing: extract the
chipset from PMC_BOOT_0, figure out the mmio base from PCI config, etc.

The renouveau-parse utility will take contents of a PFIFO pushbuffer and
decode them. The splitting to method,data pair will be done by nv-specific
code, then the pair will be handed over to generic rules-ng lookup.

4. Issues

 - Variants: what about allowing ranges like variants="NV10-NV30"? This could
   also get rid of the need for actual <variant-group>s, since they seem to be
   mostly of this form.

 - More variants: sometimes supporting a variant in one set depends on variant
   in another set. Ie. support for NV50_MEMORY_TO_MEMORY_FORMAT variant in
   grobj-class set depends on the chipset being NV5X. This can be useful
   information, but is it worth further complicating stuff?

 - Prefixes: hmm. what about allowing arbitrary constants as prefixes? In the
   example in 2.4, we're restricted to using only the domain name as prefix.
   So we either call domain "OBJECT" and end up with "OBJECT__SIZE" if we want
   to specify it, or call it "NV_OBJECT" and end up with better sounding
   "NV_OBJECT__SIZE", but screw up all the prefixed names to
   "NV04_NV_OBJECT_NAME" etc.

 - Random typing-saving feature for bitfields: make high default to same value
   as low, to have one less attribute for single-bit bitfields?

 - What about allowing nameless registers and/or bitfields? These are
   supported by renouveau.xml and are used commonly to signify an unknown
   register.

 - How about cross-ref links in <doc> tags?

 - <translation>: do we need them? Sounds awesome and useful, but as defined
   by the old spec, they're quite limited. The only examples of straight
   translations that I know of are the legacy VGA registers and
   NV50_PFB_VM_TRAP. And NV01_PDAC, but I doubt anybody gives a damn about it.
   This list is small enough to be just handled by nv-specific hacks in
   mmio-trace parser if really needed.

 - Another thing that renouveau.xml does is disassembling NV20-NV40 shaders.
   Do we want that in rules-ng? IMO we'd be better off hacking nv50dis to
   support it...

5. TODO

 - merge <variant-set>s and <enum>s
 - do away with <prefix>
 - figure out <use-domain>
