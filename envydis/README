Using envydis

envydis reads from standard input and prints the disassembly to standard
output. By default, input is parsed as sequence space- or comma-separated
hexadecimal numbers representing the bytes to disassemble. The options are:

 input format
  -w Instead of sequence of hexadecimal bytes, treat input as sequence of
     hexadecimal 32-bit words
  -W Instead of sequence of hexadecimal bytes, treat input as sequence of
     hexadecimal 64-bit words
  -i Treat input as pure binary
 input subranging
  -b <base> Assume the start of input to be at address <base> in code segment
  -d <skip> Skip/discard that many bytes of input before starting to read code
  -l <limit> Don't disassemble more than <limit> bytes.
 variant selection
  -m <machine> Select the ISA to disassemble. One of: 
     [****] nv50: nv50 [tesla] CUDA/shader ISA
     [*** ] nvc0: nvc0 [fermi] CUDA/shader ISA
     [**  ] ctx: nv40 and nv50 PGRAPH context-switching microcode
     [*** ] fuc: fifo microcode, used to power various engines on nv98+ cards
     [**  ] hwsq: PBUS hardware sequencer microcode
     [*** ] vp2: video processor 2 [nv84-gen] code, an xtensa variant
     [*   ] vp3m: video processor 3 [nv98-gen] master/mocomp microcode
     [****] macro: nvc0 PGRAPH macro method ISA
     Where the quality level is:
     [    ]: Bare beginnings
     [*   ]: Knows a few instructions
     [**  ]: Knows enough instructions to write some simple code
     [*** ]: Knows most instructions, enough to write advanced code
     [****]: Knows all instructions, or very close to.
  -V <variant> Select variant of the ISA.
     For nv50:
       nv50: The original NV50 [aka compute capability 1.0]
       nv84: NV84, NV86, NV92, NV94, NV96, NV98 [aka compute capability 1.1]
       nva0: NVA0 [aka compute capability 1.3]
       nvaa: NVAA, NVAC [aka compute capability 1.2]
       nva3: NVA3, NVA5, NVA8, NVAF [aka compute capability 1.2 + d3d10.1]
     For ctx:
       nv40: NV40 generation cards
       nv50: NV50 generation cards
     For fuc:
       nv98: NV98, NVAA, NVAC
       nva3: NVA3 and up
  -v [nv50/nvc0 only] Disassemble vertex program ISA
  -g [nv50/nvc0 only] Disassemble geometry program ISA
  -f/-p [nv50/nvc0 only] Disassemble fragment program ISA
  -c [nv50/nvc0 only] Disassemble compute program ISA
  -s [nv50/nvc0 only] Disassemble vertex, geometry, or fragment program ISA
 output format
  -n Disable output coloring
  -q Disable printing address + opcodes.

envydis can also be invoked under one of the alternative names, which imply
-m and sometimes -w options:
  - nv50dis: -m nv50 -w
  - nvc0dis: -m nvc0 -w
  - ctxdis: -m ctx -w
  - fucdis: -m fuc
  - hwsqdis: -m hwsq
  - vp2dis: -m vp2
  - vp3mdis: -m vp3m
  - macrodis: -m macro -w
