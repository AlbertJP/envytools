This directory contains tools used to manually poke or query the card
registers.

WARNING: these tools *can* and *will* hang your machine if you don't know
what you're doing. Hardware destruction is likely also possible, although
no incidents are known to have happened yet. In most cases it's also not
recommended to use these tools while a driver is active for a given card.

All programs except nvalist take an optional -c <card number> parameter.
The valid card numbers are 0 .. (card count in system - 1). If -c is not
specified, it defaults to 0. A list of cards with their numbers is given
by the nvalist program.

The programs are:

nvalist: prints a list of cards

nvapeek <address> [<byte count>]: reads 32-bit MMIO register at <address>.
If byte count is also given, reads all registers in range [address, address
+ byte count).

nvapeek8 <address> [<byte count>]: like nvapeek, but does 8-bit MMIO accesses

nvapoke <address> <value>: writes a 32-bit <value> to the MMIO register at
<address>.

nvapoke8 <address> <value>: like nvapoke, but does 8-bit MMIO access

nvawatch [-t] <address>: reads MMIO register at <address> in a loop, prints
the value every time it changes. If -t is specified, prints a timestamp
and diff from the previous timestamp before the value. Never quits, needs
to be manually aborted.

nvahammer <address> <value>: like nvapoke, but repeats the write in
an infinite loop. Needs to be manually aborted.

nvagetbios [-s <extraction method>]: extracts the card's VBIOS using the
method given as parameter and writes it to stdout. Method can be PROM or
PRAMIN. If method is not given, defaults to something sensible.

nvafuzz <address> [<byte count>]: writes random values to a register or
a register range in an infinite loop. Needs to be manually aborted.

nvascan [-as] <address> [<byte count>]: for each register in a range:
read it, write 0xffffffff, read it, write 0, read it, write back the
original value. Helpful to see the valid values for registers. If -s option
is passed, does a slow scan - waits and reads PMC.ID register between scans
to recover from errors caused by invalid register accesses. If -a option
is passed, does a cross-test on all registers in the range to detect aliased
addresses [not particularly reliable].

nvatiming: attempts to measure what frequency various units of the card are
running at by using misc tricks.
